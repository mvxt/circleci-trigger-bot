# circleci-trigger-bot

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that implements various interactions between GitHub and CircleCI

This Probot app has been written and tested using:

- Probot v7.2.0
- Node 12.13.0
- Yarn v1.17.3

## Current Functionality
### Trigger Builds via PR Comments
#### Pipeline Trigger
Triggers a pipeline with the specified parameters. Leave a comment in the following format on a PR:

`circleci run pipeline [PARAM_1=VALUE_1 PARAM_2=VALUE_2...]`

**Note:** Triggering a pipeline will trigger **all workflows** by default. To limit which workflows run and when, you'll want to configure parameters and defaults. See the docs [here](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/blob/master/docs/conditional-workflows.md).

## Installing the Bot
Since Github Apps cannot currently store secrets, you'll have to hardcode your CircleCI API token into the code.

This seems insecure, but the configuration of this app in `app.yml` is set to "Internal-only" by default, meaning other users on Github cannot install the app or see its source code.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Search the code base for REPLACE_TOKEN_HERE and replace it with your [CircleCI API Token](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/).
3. Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm i`
4. Start the app with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`, which will start your app and start a web server on http://localhost:3000
5. Go to that page in your browser and click the button to register GitHub App
6. Make a unique name for your Github App and install the application in your org. Then click on the "App Settings" button near the top

## Testing
1. Run `yarn test` after you've installed dependencies.
